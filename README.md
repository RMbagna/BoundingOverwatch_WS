# Bounding Overwatch Human-Robot Study

This repository hosts the **Bounding Overwatch Human-Robot Study**, a research platform designed to study human decision-making in tactical multi-robot team coordination contexts. The system collects human responses during simulated bounding overwatch missions, and applies **Decision Field Theory (DFT)** to estimate cognitive parameters and project choice evolution.

---

## Project Overview

* **Goal:**
  Bounding Overwatch is a critical tactical maneuver used when enemy engagement is highly probable. It involves coordinated teams, where one provides security cover while the other advances. This study investigates how human operators make decisions under high-stakes and low-stakes conditions while relying on robotic assistance. It evaluates how robots influence path selection, risk assessment, and team safety.

* **Key Features:**

  * Human-in-the-loop decision-making experiment design
  * Implementation of **Decision Field Theory (DFT)** for modeling preferences
  * Experimental conditions: High-Stakes vs Low-Stakes missions, Robot Bias, and Robot Neutral
  * A **graphical user interface (GUI)** for participants to interact with multi-robot teams
  * **Data collection** of human decisions and robot selection behavior
  * Integration with **Apollo.R** to estimate DFT-related parameters from human choice data
  * **MATLAB parsing** of estimated parameters to simulate preference dynamics and project decision evolution over time

## Experiment Procedure

Your team requires urgent medical assistance in uncharted territory. The robots (blue triangles) are deployed ahead to provide security cover while transmitting critical data on:  
- **Traversability:** Ease of navigation  
- **Visibility:** Limiting exposure to adversaries  
- **Relative positions:** Distance from the operator (red circle)  

Carefully analyze this information and choose your path to ensure the safety of your team while minimizing the risk of detection. Participants are prompted with:  

*"Do you accept the mission?"*

### Scenarios
- **High Stakes:** Rescue Mission during Active Fire  
- **Low Stakes:** Surveying Terrain before Sundown  

### Observed Consequences
- **C1:** High Traversability, Low Exposure to adversary  
- **C2:** Low Traversability, Low Exposure to adversary  
- **C3:** High Traversability, High Exposure to adversary  
- **C4:** Low Traversability, High Exposure to adversary  

### Interaction Guidelines
- Hover the mouse over each robot to see possible consequences.  
- Hover over the operator to see the current traversability and visibility need.  
- If a robot appears behind the legend, refresh the page to reposition elements.

## Setup Requirements

* MATLAB (for preference dynamics simulation)
* R Software Program (for Apollo-DFT integration)
* Required R package:
  
  ```
  R
  install.packages("apollo")
  ````

---

## Workflow

1. **Experiment Execution**

   * Participants interact with the GUI and make path decisions based on robot feedback.
   * The study includes two main phases:

     * **Scenario Evaluation:** Participants observe robot-reported terrain data (traversability, visibility, position) and assess risks for each path.
     * **Path Selection & Robot Pairing:** Participants choose a robot-assisted path. Robots differ in attributes (e.g., energy, pace, safety, reliability, computational capacity), and participant choices reveal preference patterns under different stakes.

2. **Parameter Estimation (Apollo.R)**

   * Human response data is processed with Apollo.R to estimate **DFT parameters**.
   * Outputs include individual-level parameter sets (e.g., attention weights, sensitivity, error variance).

3. **Preference Dynamics Simulation (MATLAB)**

   * Estimated parameters are parsed into MATLAB scripts.
   * The system projects **choice evolution** over time, modeling dynamic decision-making under risk and uncertainty using DFT.

If you want, I can also **adjust the “Workflow” diagrams and consequence descriptions** to visually mirror your GUI, so the README fully conveys the **mission-based, tactical decision flow** for reviewers and GitHub users.  

Do you want me to do that next?

## Workflow

1. **Experiment Execution**

   * Participants interact with the GUI and make choices among available robot options in bounding overwatch scenarios.
   * Choices are logged along with experimental conditions.
   * The study includes three main phases:

     * **Pre-selection:** Observes inherent biases toward working alone or expecting robot support.
     * **Task Selection:** Participants assign themselves roles or tasks; each role differs in attributes such as efficiency, speed, safety, and skill.
     * **Robot Pairing:** Participants choose among robots with different performance attributes (energy, pace, safety, reliability, computational capacity), observing how preferences evolve under high- and low-stake conditions.

2. **Parameter Estimation (Apollo.R)**

   * Human response data is processed with Apollo.R to estimate **DFT parameters**.
   * Outputs include individual-level parameter sets (e.g., attention weights, sensitivity, error variance).

3. **Preference Dynamics Simulation (MATLAB)**

   * Estimated parameters are parsed into MATLAB scripts.
   * The system projects **choice evolution** over time, modeling dynamic human-robot decision processes using DFT.
